# Parsers to automatically instantiate objects, upload data and fill property fields

## Division 6.4 and datastore team, BAM

## WebProtégé, PyBIS, pyRDF, workflow managers

### Summary:

We would like to propose automated solutions that interface with generated data (e.g., could be through a workflow manager like [pyiron](https://github.com/pyiron)) and upload them to openBIS. While some prototypes already exist, we would like to eventually develop a robust and streamlined tool that makes it easy and intuitive for users to automatically upload their data. An important consideration here is that the solutions should be sustainable, easily extendable and maintainable for the data stewards. An initial design proposal is given in the schematic below.
